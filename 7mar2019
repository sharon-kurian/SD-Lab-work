Flowers are the reproductive parts of flowering plants. 
A flower is a special part of the plant.
Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.
In all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part.
We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. 
There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. 
Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.

Flowers are an important evolutionary advance made by flowering plants.
 Some flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species.
 The role of flowers is to produce seeds, which are contained in fruit.

Flowers are an important evolutionary advance made by flowering plants.
 Some flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species.
 Their pollen grains are light-weight. Many others rely on insects or birds to move pollen.
 Theirs are heavier.
 The role of flowers is to produce seeds, which are contained in fruit. 
Fruits and seeds are a means of dispersal.
 Plants do not move, but wind, animals and birds spread the plants across the landscape.
