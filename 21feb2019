more command is used to view the text files in the command prompt, displaying on
e screen at a time in case the file is large (For example log files). The more c
ommand also allows the user do scroll up and down through the page. The syntax a
long with options and command is as follows. Another application of more is to u
se it with some other command after a pipe. When output is large, we can use mor
e command to see output one by one.

    [-options]: any option that you want to use in order to change the way the f

xt file.

n the screen.
